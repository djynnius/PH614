## Learning objectives  
- Understand numeric summaries  
- Understand categorical summaries  
- Carry out a univariate analysis  

## Quick review of what we should know  
- Data is generally classed in two:  
    + Numeric (Quantitative)  
    + Categorical (Non-numeric or Qualitative)  
- Categorical data may be:
    + Binary (with only two levels)
    + Have more than two levels  
```SAS
/*
Also remember 
Numeric 
    Continuous  
    Count  
Categorical 
    Binary 
    Nominal 
    Ordinal
*/
```  

## Univariate analysis  
- This simply refers to analysing a single variable  
- Broadly we could consider variables as **numeric** or **categorical**  
- Univariate analysis will involve three parts generally being:
    + Variable summaries  
    + Visualization of variable distibution  
    + Hypothesis testing  
- Our focus today is on variable summaries  
- Every data analysis begins with just knowing about the data; the number of records (observations) and the number of variables ans what type each is  

## First look  
```SAS 
libname PH614 '/path/to/folder';

/*
Let's explore the contents of a dataset in our library
This will inform us of the number of records and variables 
It will also make a guess of each variable type
*/

PROC CONTENTS DATA=PH614.NHANES_new;
RUN;
```  

## Numeric summaries  
- What summaries we need from a numeric variable  
    + Number of expected records (**PROC CONTENTS** would have told us this)  
    + Number missing  
    + Data distribution  
        + Normal or not Normal
    + Minimum value  
    + Maximum value  
    + First Quartile (Q1)  
    + Median (Q2)  
    + Third Quartile (Q3)  
    + Mean 
    + Standard Deviation  
    + Range (Maximum - Minimum) 
    + Inter Quartile range (Q3 - Q1)  

## Measures of center and spread  
- A histogram will tell us if our data is normally distributed or not  
- A bell shaped curve suggests normality, similar curves may be considered approximately normal (this is a judgement call)  
- When a numeric variable is normally distributed then:
    + It's center is represented by the mean (arithmetic average) 
    + It's spread is represented by the standard deviation (1$\sigma$ = 68%, 2$\sigma$=95%, 3$\sigma$99.7%)  
- When a variable is not normally distributed then:
    + It's center is best represented by the median (Q2) as this is closer to the true center of the data and more resilient than the mean which tends to be dragged in the direction of outliers  
    + It's spread is consequently best represented by the interquartile range (IQR) which represents the central 50%  

## The univariarte analysis with SAS  
- There are two ways of getting this done with SAS using either the **UNIVARIATE** proceedure or the **MEANS** procedure  
- First lets look at the univariate procedure AKA **PROC UNIVARIATE**  
```SAS  
PROC UNIVARIATE DATA=PH614.NHANES_mini;
VAR Age; *This line tells SAS to carry out an analysis of the numeric variable Age;
HISTOGRAM Age; *This line tells SAS to draw a histogram of the Age variable;
RUN;
```  
- Next we consider PROC MEANS which will allow us specify what we want to see as summaries  
```SAS 
/*
Here we list what summaries we want and in no particular order  
MIN: Minimum 
MAX: Maximum 
Q1: First Quartile  
Q3: Third Quartile  
MEDIAN: Median 
MEAN: Mean 
RANGE: MAX - MIN 
QRANGE: Q3 - Q1 
MEAN: Mean
STD: Standard Deviation 
*/
PROC MEANS DATA=PH614.NHANES_mini MIN Q1 MEDIAN Q3 MAX RANGE QRANGE MEAN STD;
VAR Age;
RUN;
```  

## Categorical summaries  
- For categorical variables we are interested in  
    + Number of expected records  
    + Missing variables  
    + Number of levels/categories 
    + Names of the levels/categories    
    + Number of records in each category (frequency)  
    + Proportion of records in each category 
    + Percentage of records in each category  

## Using SAS for categorical univariate analysis  
- The name UNIVARIATE was already used for numeric summaries so SAS uses something different for categorical variables  
- It looks for frequencies hence the name **FREQ**  
```SAS  
PROC FREQ DATA=PH614.NHANES_mini;
*This simply says create a frequency table for the education variable;
TABLE Education;
RUN;
```
