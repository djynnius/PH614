## Learning Objectives  
- Create new data sets  
- Rename variables  
- Select variables 
- Drop variables  
- Understand operators 
- Filter data with logic 
- Creating new variables  
- Merge two data sets based on an ID or to complete records  
- Sort data  
- Formating vatiables 

## The Data step  
- SAS lets you create new data sets each time you use the **DATA** step  
- Typical structure of the DATA step is:
```SAS 
*This is a blank temporary dataset;
DATA new_data;
RUN;
``` 
- New data sets not prefixed with a library name will be temorary! 
- To make a permanent dataset make sure the library you want it to be in exists then...  
```SAS
DATA lib.new_data;
RUN;
```

## Creating a new data set from an existing data set  
- Often we use existing data as the basis for our dataset in SAS. To do this we use the **SET** keyword  
```SAS
*Create a new data set; 
DATA lib.new_data;
SET lib.existing_data;
RUN;

*Look at your log and next run PROC CONTENTS to see if the new dataset was properly created;
PROC CONTENTS DATA=lib.new_data;
RUN;
```
- Note every time you use the **DATA** step you create a new dataset and if the name already exists it will overwrite the existing dataset!!! Watch out for this.  


## Rename Variables  
- There are times you want your variable to have a more prepresentative name  
- You can rename the variables, the caveat is there can only be alphabets, numbers and underscores in the variables names and they should only begin with letters  
- Use the **RENAME** keyword followed by old_var_name=new_var_name 
- You can have multiple of these rename pairs as you need  
```SAS  
DATA PH614.new_data;
SET PH614.existing_data;
RENAME Sex=Gender Ethnicity=Race Education=Tranining; 
RUN;

*Look at your log and next run PROC CONTENTS to see what changed;
PROC CONTENTS DATA=lib.new_data;
RUN;
```  

## Keeping variables  
- There are times when you are not interested in all the variables in a dataset  
- You can decide to keep some out of several variables in a new dataset without losing your original dataset  
- To keep some variables use the keyword **KEEP**  
```SAS  
DATA PH614.new_data;
SET PH614.existing_data;
KEEP Age Sex Race Education;
RUN;

*Look at your log and next run PROC CONTENTS to see what variables are kept;
PROC CONTENTS DATA=lib.new_data;
RUN;
```  

## Droping vaariables  
- This is the opposite of keeping, and serves where you want to drop a few variables you are not interested in  
- The **DROP** keyword is what is required to achieve this  
```SAS  
DATA PH614.new_data;
SET PH614.existing_data;
DROP Weight Height;
RUN;

*Look at your log and next run PROC CONTENTS to see what changed;
PROC CONTENTS DATA=lib.new_data;
RUN;
```  

## Combining variable manipulation  
- You can combine the variable manipulation steps as required.  
- Make sure you end each step with a semi colon  
```SAS  
DATA PH614.new_data;
SET PH614.existing_data;
KEEP Age Sex Race Education Weight Height;
RENAME Sex=Gender;
RUN;

*Look at your log and next run PROC CONTENTS to see what changed;
PROC CONTENTS DATA=lib.new_data;
RUN;
```  

## Operators 
- SAS lets you carry out a couple of a few operations  
- First lets use the assignment operator **=** to create a new variable and set its value 
```SAS 
DATA PH614.new_data;
SET PH614.existing_data;
Test = 4; *Numbers are writen without quotes;
Annother_test = "Hello"; *Non numbers are written with quotes;
RUN;

*Look at your log and next run PROC CONTENTS to see what changed;
PROC CONTENTS DATA=lib.new_data;
RUN;
```

## Mathematical operators  
- SAS supports mathematical operators including **+**, **-**, **/**, **\*** 
- SAS also supports operator precedence (PEMDAS)   
- Lets explore this 
```SAS 
DATA PH614.new_data;
SET PH614.existing_data;
BMI = Weight/(Height*Height); 
RUN;

*Look at your log and next run PROC CONTENTS to see what changed;
PROC CONTENTS DATA=lib.new_data;
RUN;
```

## SAS IF-THEN-ELSE logic  
- Apart from mathematical operators, SAS supports comparision operators such as **>**, **<**, **>=**, **<=**  
- SAS as a programing language has provisions for logic an decision points  
- Using this construct we can check for truth and decide to do something if a true condition is met  
- the typical construct uses the words **IF** condition **THEN** do something; Lets see an example  
```SAS
DATA new_data;
SET existing_data;
IF Age < 18 THEN Age_group = "Child";
ELSE IF 18 <= Age <= 60 THEN Age_group = "Adult";
ELSE Age_group = "Elder";
RUN;

*Look at your log and next run PROC CONTENTS to see what changed;
PROC CONTENTS DATA=lib.new_data;
RUN;
```  
- The statement may be writen without the **ELSE IF** and **ELSE** portions  

## Filetering data using the IF statement    
- We can filter based on a variable using the IF statement  
```SAS
DATA new_data;
SET existing_data;
IF Sex = 'Male';
RUN;

*Look at your log and next run PROC CONTENTS to see what changed;
PROC CONTENTS DATA=lib.new_data;
RUN;
```

## Filetering data using the WHERE clause    
- We can filter based on a variable using the IF statement  
```SAS
DATA new_data;
SET existing_data;
WHERE Sex = 'Male';
RUN;

*Look at your log and next run PROC CONTENTS to see what changed;
PROC CONTENTS DATA=lib.new_data;
RUN;
```
