## Learning Objectives  
- Understand what SAS is 
- Importing data into SAS  
- The SAS workspace 
- How to learn a new programing language  
- The basic construct of SAS  
- What to do when you get a new data set  

## Course structure  
- We will be using web presentations  
- SAS code shells will be included for download and will help follow the class 
  

## Understanding SAS    
- SAS is both a programing language of stattistical data analysis and a program  
- SAS versions  
    + SAS desktop  
    + SAS on demand: https://welcome.oda.sas.com  
- There are some differences in setting up, upoading data, initial setup  
- The language is syntax is consistent accross all platforms  
- One of the grat things about using programing languages is your code is reusable!  

## Getting data into SAS  
- Open the SAS program  
- Click on import data as CSV   
- Follow the wizard  
    + Click on 

## Libraries and datasets  
- Desktop **folders** and **files** in the file system are how we navigate to find things  
- SAS has a similar construct with **libraries** and **datasets** 
- SAS **libraries** are like desktop **folders**  
- SAS **datasets** are like desktop **files**  
- You need to create libraries on SAS for your datasets  
- Not creating libraries means datasets get stored in a default library called **WORK**  
- The WORK library getsdeleted each time we close the SAS application  
- When creating a dataset the only limitation is the name should be limited to eight characters  

## The SAS workspace  
- The default SAS workspace has the following windows 
    + The expolorer in the left that lets us look throught the desktop filesystem and SAS libraries  
    + Code window: where you write code    
    + Log window: that tells you if your code ran successfully  or if there was some warning of an error or if your code completely failed to run    
    + Results window: where you view the result of your code   
    + Data window: where you view datasets    

## SAS programing construct  
- SAS language commands has two major branches 
    + Procedures (**PROC**) 
    + Data  (**DATA**)
    + Every instruction line ends in a semicolon **;**  
    + Every code block (set of instructions) ends with the key word **RUN**  

## How to learn a new programing language  
- Understand the language construct: 
1. Data types  
2. Operators  
3. Control structure: logic  
4. Control structure: loops  
5. Functions 

## How we will be learning SAS  
- Data types  
- Manipulating data (data wrangling) 
    + Operators 
    + logic 
- Analysing single variables 
- Analysing variable pairs 
- Visualizing data 
- Testing hypotheses 

## Data types  
- Quantitative (numeric) data
    + Coninuous data - no clear separation of levels or too many levels:
        + Weight - 170.3, 182.4, 193.22, 172.0,  ...
        + Age - range from 0 to 100  
    + Count (Discrete) data  - clear distinction between levels:
        + Number of days in on admission in hospital - 3, 5, 2, 4, 0, 1, 1, 2, ...
- Qualitative (categorical) data  
    + Binary data (2 levels only)  
        + Sex - male, female, female, female, male, female, ...
        + Status - dead, alive, alive, alive, alive, alive, dead, alive, ...
        + Smoker - yes, no, no , yes, yes, no, yes, no, no, yes, yes, ...
    + Nominal data (named data with no inherent order)  
        + State_of_residence - MD, AZ, NY, NY, VA, CA, TX, TX, NY, ...
    + Ordinal data (named data with inherent order) 
        + sizes - small, medium, small, large, large, small, extra large, medium, small, ... 

## Typical structure of datasets  
- Think about an excel spreadsheet 
- It has columns and rows  
- The columns represent variables in your dataset 
- The rows represent information about each assessment 
- If 20 people were queried about their age, sex, occupation the dataset would have:
    + 3 columns (one each for age, sex and occupation)
    + 20 rows (for each person assessed)

## Exploring a newly imported dataset  
- You want to get the documentation for the dataset so you know what the dataset is about and what the variables mean  
- You want to know how many **variables** (columns) are in the dataset 
- How many **observations** (rows) in the dataset 
- Which variables are quantitative (numerical) and which are qualitative (categorical)  

## Exploring data with SAS  
- Get a summary of the data  
```SAS
PROC CONTENTS DATA=PH614.NHANES;
RUN;  
```  
- View the first few observations  
```SAS
/*This code lets you view the first 10 observations, 
as this prevents your computer from trying to load all 
the datra at once which may be too much to look at at once
*/
PROC PRINT DATA=PH614.NHANES (OBS=10);
RUN;
```
